# crawldata-modeling-CNN-KNN-Randomforest-Naivebayes
I crawl data from a dictionary website about flowers, I crawl both information and images of flowers, including more than 1500 information data and 3000 images.
From there, I made many models to be able to predict the accuracy of each flower KHDL.py file is the way to crawl that website
The file Data Science.ipynb is the file where I preprocessed the data (normalized, cleaned, reduced dimensionality,...) and from there made many models including:
  + Regarding flower information, I made 3 models including KNN, random forest, naive bayes to be able to compare the 3 models more easily.
  + Regarding Images, I made 2 models: CNN and KNN to easily compare accuracy

Thank you everyone for reading!!
